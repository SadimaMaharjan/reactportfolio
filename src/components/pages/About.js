        Hi! I am Sadima and I love working in front-end web development. I enjoy
        playing with colors, designs and various CSS and JavaScript effects and
        animations. My interest in web development developed when I was working
        as an intern for a company that developed Wordpress websites. I decided
        to dive into web design after that and worked as a junior web-designer.
        Besides work, I love hiking, trekking and gardening.
